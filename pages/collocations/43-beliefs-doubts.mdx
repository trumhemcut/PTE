## Story

When you **strongly/firmly believe** something, we can call it a **deeply-held belief** or an **unshakable belief** – the latter phrase implies that it would be difficult to convince you to change your mind. It’s possible to have a **subconscious belief** – a belief that you are not actively aware of. Your emotions can also **color your judgment** _(influence your opinions/decisions)._

A lot of people **believe in superstitions** – irrational beliefs that have no basis in fact, like the number 13 being unlucky. Others have a **blind faith** _(believe in something without thinking)_ in fate or destiny. When new evidence appears, it can either **strengthen/reinforce your belief** *(make it stronger)*or **undermine/weaken your belief** _(make it weaker)._

When forming your beliefs, be careful about **making assumptions,** which can **lead to erroneous conclusions.** False **beliefs held** by many people are called **common misconceptions.** Scientists and other researchers often publish material to help **dispel misconceptions** _(eliminate them)_ – for example, **“Contrary to popular belief,** it’s not harmful to go swimming immediately after eating.”

If you are completely sure about something, then you can describe it as **“beyond/without a shadow of a doubt.”** But sometimes **doubts arise** – or another person **voices their doubts** – thus making you reconsider. Maybe the doubts don’t even come from a fact, but you just have **a sneaking suspicion –** a persistent feeling – that **casts doubts on** things you previously assumed to be true.
When you have a small doubt that persists and continues to bother you – this is called a **gnawing/lingering/nagging/niggling doubt.** This might be an indication that it’s time to **rethink/ reexamine your beliefs –** after **further consideration**, you just might **arrive at a different conclusion.**
