# 40. Cause & Effect

## Story

The word “cause” is primarily used with negative results: a storm can **cause damage,** a mechanical defect can **cause a problem,** unclear instructions can **cause confusion,** a political scandal can **cause an uproar** _(a strong negative reaction/manifestation from the public),_ a high-risk sport can **cause injury,** and an infection in a hospital can **cause death.**

You can describe something as **cause for concern** or **cause for alarm** – meaning a reason for concern or alarm. For example, “The growing number of teenagers dropping out of school is **cause for concern.”** The word “alarm” is a little stronger and more urgent: “The rapid spread of the virus is **cause for alarm.”** One of the only positive collocations with “cause” is **cause for celebration:** “The opening of the new school was **cause for celebration** in the community.”

When analyzing a problem, you can identify the **main/primary cause** of the issue – but keep in mind that there may be **hidden/underlying causes** as well. The deepest or most fundamental cause is sometimes called the **root cause.**

Interestingly, we do not use the verb “cause” together with “effect.” Instead, we say that something **has an effect** – for example, “Television **has a strong effect** on public opinion.” Another way to say “a strong effect” is the expression **a significant impact** or **a profound impact.**

There are many different ways to describe effects:

- **short-term** vs. **long-term effects** – the time of the effect
- **visible effects** vs. **subtle effects** – whether or not the effects are obvious
- **powerful effect** vs. **minimal/negligible effect** – how strong the effect was
- **beneficial effect** vs. **adverse effect** – to describe positive and negative effects
- **main effect** vs. **side effect** – to describe the primary effect or an additional effect
  
  Something can also **have/produce results** – the **preliminary results** are the early ones, and after more time passes, you’ll get the **final results**. Results that obviously exist and can be proved are called **concrete/tangible results,** and a result that is impossible to avoid is an **inevitable result.** Results can also be **direct or indirect,** and the result that you want is called **the desired result.**

  One word that is similar to “result” is “outcome” – it describes a resulting situation. You can try to guess the **likely/probable outcome** – the **logical outcome** is the result you would expect, and an **unexpected outcome** is one you didn’t predict.
