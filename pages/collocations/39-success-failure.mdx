## Story

Successful Samantha has a long list of **impressive accomplishments.** It seems like everything she does ends up being a **phenomenal success.** In her very first job, she created a **highly effective** way to motivate the company’s employees, resulting in a **dramatic improvement** in workplace morale.

Now she’s developing a system for real-time translation among 100 different languages. If she can pull it off, it’ll be an **unprecedented success** _(success in something for the first time in history)_ and the **crowning achievement** _(best or most significant achievement)_ of her career.

So far, the program has enjoyed **modest success** _(some limited success)_ but there is still **room for improvement** _(potential for improvement)._ However, Samantha says that the team is **making good progress,** and that in the next month or two she hopes to **make a breakthrough** _(make a sudden advance in success, especially when you overcome an obstacle)_.

Although Samantha is very ambitious, she’s also a very likeable person. She **brings out the best** in other people, and quickly **wins the respect** of colleagues.

Samantha’s brother, Disastrous Dan, is the opposite – everything he attempts seems to **fail miserably**. He wanted to be a doctor, but his teachers told him he wasn’t smart enough, **dashing his hopes** _(making him abandon hope)_ of a career in medicine. He had the opportunity to do a prestigious internship in another country, but he **lost his nerve** *(lost his courage)*and turned down the offer. He then applied for various jobs, but **completely failed** to show up to the interviews on time. He was eventually hired, but later lost his job during an economic downturn due to his **mediocre performance** _(average work, not very special)_ and total lack of **remarkable achievements.**

Dan then tried to start his own software company to compete with Samantha’s; that was a **spectacular failure.** He invested his life savings in the business, despite all his friends telling him that it would be **a recipe for disaster** _(very likely to result in disaster)_. His sales predictions were **way off the mark** _(completely inaccurate)_, and the company **went under** _(lost all its money and shut down)_ just eight months after it was founded.

Poor Dan – it seems like he’s **doomed to failure** _(destined to be unsuccessful)_. But **if all else fails** _(if everything is unsuccessful)_, he can always move into Samantha’s mansion **as a last resort** _(a final possibility)!_
