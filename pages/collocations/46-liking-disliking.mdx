## Story

_Read and listen to these three people talking about likes and dislikes:_
“I’m a **lifelong fan** of U2 – they’re my **all-time favorite** band. In addition to the **sheer enjoyment** _(pure pleasure)_ of listening to their music, I’m also a **great admirer** of Bono and his philanthropic work. He’s concerned not only with the **fleeting pleasure** _(momentary enjoyment)_ of fame and fortune, but also with making a difference in the world. I **hold him in the highest regard** _(have great respect for him)_ for this reason.”

“When my daughter was a baby, I noticed that she **developed a particular liking for** classical music, and when she was six I signed her up for violin classes. It was a **real pleasure** to see her **obvious enjoyment** of the lessons. She **grew quite attached** _(strongly like/love over time)_ to her teacher, who says that she has the potential to turn her **great love** of music into a professional career. Now my daughter is 13 and lately she’s expressed a **clear preference** for the most difficult pieces of music – she says she wants a challenge.”

“I **took an instant dislike** to Sam from the moment we were introduced. Within five minutes, he was talking about his **deep dislike** of foreigners – without knowing that my own parents were immigrants from Argentina. He said he **had nothing but contempt** _(only hate)_ for people who abandoned their own countries to come to ours, and then began making horribly racist jokes and comments. I have no idea where Sam’s **blind/irrational hatred** *(hatred without a logical reason)*of foreigners comes from, but he seems to have **developed a strong aversion** *(developed an intense dislike)*to interacting with anyone who’s the slightest bit different from him. I try to be polite, but deep down I **hate him with a passion** _(hate him a LOT)._”
